<h1>Final Project Description - Sarah Pardo and Annie Liu</h1>
<h2>CS 307 SP 21</h2>
<h3>Happy Hopping Bunny</h3>

<h4>Creating the scene</h4>
<p>Our scene shows a hopping bunny traveling through the seasons in a forest. We
  drew inspiration from an earlier student project that shows a fox walking
  through the woods. To get started, we drew some sketches of what a forest
  scene could look like. Ultimately, we changed the structure of our scene to
  include four seasons and the ability to continually rotate throug them.

<p>We created a cylinder with a radius of 100 and divided it into quadrants,
  one for each season. Then we used texture mapping to create the effect of
  seasonal woods background on the wall and ground on the base of the cylinder.

<h4>Adding static objects</h4>
<p>
  We added trees and bushes using nested, composite objects. We had a deciduous model and a
  pine model, and mapped different textures to the trees and bushes according to the
  season quadrant they belonged in. To help hide the
  transitions in seasons, we added tree trunks between each "season" that mask
  the edge of each background image.

<h4>Creating the bunny</h4>
<p>Before coding our bunny, we sketched out some simple designs with pseudo code
to get a sense of what THREE.js geometries we would be able to use. </p>

<p>
  Our final bunny is based on the code from the teddy bear function in class. We created
  functions for the head, torso, and limbs. We used Phong material for the body and eyes of
  the bunny (giving the eyes a high shininess to make them reflective) and basic material
  for the nose.

<h4>Animating the bunny and changing the camera</h4>
<p>
  We used animation to have our bunny hop in a circle (radius of 30) and simultaneously make
  the legs rotate while it hops to give the illusion of pushing off the ground. Additionally,
  we changed the camera position so that it follows the movement of the bunny as it hops
  around in the circle.

              and how the camera view point also changed.

</figure>

<h4>User Interaction and Lighting</h4>
<p>
  We implemented simple controls for user interaction, mainly SPC to stop the animation and
  "g" to continue it. For lighting, we added an ambient, directional, point, and spot light.
